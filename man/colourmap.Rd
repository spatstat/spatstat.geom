\details{
  A colour map is a mechanism for associating colours with data.
  It can be regarded as a function, mapping data to colours.

  The command \code{colourmap} creates an object representing
  a colour map, which can then be used to control the plot commands
  in the \pkg{spatstat} package. It can also be used to compute the
  colour assigned to any data value. 

  The argument \code{col} specifies the colours to which
  data values will be mapped. It should be a vector
  whose entries can be interpreted as colours by the standard
  \R graphics system. The entries can be string names of colours
  like \code{"red"}, or integers that refer to
  colours in the standard palette, or strings containing
  six-letter hexadecimal codes like \code{"#F0A0FF"}. 

  Exactly one of the arguments \code{range}, \code{inputs} or \code{breaks}
  must be specified by name.

  \itemize{
    \item
    If \code{inputs} is given, then it should be a vector or factor,
    of the same length as \code{col}. The entries of \code{inputs} can be
    any atomic type (e.g. numeric, logical, character, complex) or factor
    values. The resulting colour map associates the value \code{inputs[i]}
    with the colour \code{col[i]}.
    The argument \code{col} should have the same length as \code{inputs}.
    \item
    If \code{range} is given, then it determines the interval of the real
    number line that will be mapped. It should be a numeric vector of
    length 2. The interval will be divided evenly into bands, each of which is
    assigned one of the colours in \code{col}. (If \code{gamma} is given,
    then the bands are equally spaced on a scale where the original values
    are raised to the power \code{gamma}.)
    \item
    If \code{breaks} is given, then it determines the precise intervals
    of the real number line
    which are mapped to each colour. It should be a numeric vector,
    of length at least 2, with entries that are in increasing order.
    Infinite values are allowed. Any number in the range
    between \code{breaks[i]} and \code{breaks[i+1]} will be mapped to the
    colour \code{col[i]}. 
    The argument \code{col} should have length equal to
    \code{length(breaks) - 1}.
  }
  It is also permissible for \code{col} to be a single colour value,
  representing a trivial colour map in which all data values are mapped to
  the same colour.
  
  The result is an object of class \code{"colourmap"}. 
  There are \code{print} and \code{plot} methods for this class.
  Some plot commands in the \pkg{spatstat} package accept an object
  of this class as a specification of the colour map.

  The result is also a function \code{f} which can be used to compute
  the colour assigned to any data value. 
  That is, \code{f(x)} returns the character value of the colour assigned
  to \code{x}. This also works for vectors of data values.
