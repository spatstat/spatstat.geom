        CHANGES IN spatstat.geom VERSION 1.65-0

    o Increased speed for large datasets.

    o Bug fix in crossdist.pp3 with periodic distances.
    
    o Bug fixes and minor improvements.

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o spatstat.geom
    The package 'spatstat.geom' has been created from a subset
    of the code in the original 'spatstat' package version 1.65-0.
    It contains definitions of geometrical objects (windows, point patterns,
    pixel images, etc) and operations on them (geometry, superposition,
    image arithmetic, etc).

    o Execution
    The 'spatstat.geom' package is slightly faster than the corresponding
    code in the 'spatstat' package, because the procedure for calling
    internal C functions has been streamlined.

    o dirichletEdges
    New argument 'clip'.

    o harmonise.im
    The result belongs to class 'solist' and 'imlist'
    so that it can be plotted.

BUG FIXES

    o crossdist.pp3
    Results with periodic=TRUE were partially incorrect.
    Fixed.
    
    o affine.owin
    For mask windows, the pixel resolution of the result
    was too fine, leading to very large datasets.
    Fixed.

    o affine.im
    If the transformation matrix was not diagonal, the pixel resolution
    of the result was too fine, leading to very large datasets.
    Fixed.

    o plot.ppp
    For a point pattern in a binary mask window,
    if both arguments 'col' and 'cols' were given,
    the points were coloured according to 'col', which was incorrect.
    Fixed.
    
    o dirichletEdges
    Crashed if any edges crossed the boundary of the window.
    Fixed.

    o unitname
    Spatial datasets with incorrect internal format
    (or using an out-of-date version of the spatstat format)
    caused an error if the 'units' package was loaded.
    Fixed.
